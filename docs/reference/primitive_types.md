# Primitive Types

* `Int` (8 bytes) - 64-bit signed integer
* `Float` (8 bytes) - 64-bit floating-point number
* `Bool` - Boolean value (`true` or `false`)
* `Char` - single character
* `Byte` - 8-bit unsigned integer
* `Pointer` - raw memory address *(only meaningful in `unsafe` code)*

> Any primitive may have a **nullable** counterpart via `?` (e.g., `Int?`).
